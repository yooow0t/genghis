# genghis
An interpreter for a subset of scheme. I called it Genghis because it was the first
thing that came to me. I hope that Genghis Khan dosen't mind.

# features
Currently this interpreter only does 
+ `+`
+ `=`
+ `*`
+ `/`
+ `abs`
+ `remainder`
+ `expt`
I will hopefuly be adding lambdas, definitions, more logic, conditionals and all of
the creature comforts we've come to expect from scheme.
