# Genghis - A subset of Scheme. 
I called it Genghis because it was the first thing that came to me.
I hope Genghis Khan dosen't mind.

# features
Currently this interpreter only does the following opperations 
+ `+`
+ `=`
+ `*`
+ `/`
+ `abs`
+ `remainder`
+ `expt`

I will hopefuly be adding lambdas, definitions, more logic, conditionals and all of
the other creature comforts we've come to expect from a Scheme.
