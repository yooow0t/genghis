# Genghis - A subset of Scheme. 
I called it Genghis because it was the first thing that came to me.
I hope Genghis Khan doesn't mind.

Genghis is similar to scheme but, without cond, lambda, set, let or any facilities for syntax definition.
Genghis' division operator may return a float even if the arguments are integers.

# Running Genghis
Genghis may be run by pointing your python3 interpreter at the `genghis.py` file.
